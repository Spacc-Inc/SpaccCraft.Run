# SpaccCraft.Run
One-click SpaccCraft Launcher

Playing SpaccCraft (Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 + QoL mods) just by starting a single, portable executable.

### How to use

Download the [compiled package](https://github.com/Spacc-Inc/SpaccCraft.Run/releases/latest) for your platform (or build it yourself, to do so you will need JRE and Minecraft files from other sources),
make it executable, and start it.
Enter your username and any password (launcher is not premium), then close, and restart.
Everything is now ready for you to play!

All settings and game progress is saved automatically, (usually in `~/.config/SpaccCraft.Run`)

### TODO
- Add a quick way to change username and toggle mods (maybe a small config window?)

### Known issues
- Only on the first startup, after entering the desired username, the program must be restarted.
